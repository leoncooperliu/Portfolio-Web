                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">It is true that for psychologically reason, sometimes, we
                        fail to understand things as they truly are. Especially significant things such as Diana's
                        death, and the Apollo project. People just can't understand how those things can be. Since Diana
                        was so charming and famous, how could she die if she was not murdered? Conspiracies is a form of
                        over-explanation because we can't believe sometimes things happen accidentally, which happens a
                        lot in film reviews. Filmmaking is a business involving high risk and uncertainty. Some
                        brilliant acting you see in the final picture might not be planned out in the first place. The
                        well-known example would be the cat in Godfather Part I. At the opening scene of Godfather,
                        Marlon Brando is petting a white furry cat, which show a soft side behind the powerful notorious
                        Godfather Vito Corleone. People celebrate how smart and insightful director Francis Ford Coppola
                        was. However, the reality is that the cat is never planned. The crew found the cat on the set
                        and Coppola just have Brando holds it in the scene. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">You know it is not real but you still love it (Shipping/
                        Political Fan Fic)
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">I never understand why people are so crazy about shipping.
                        What I see the word might be different from the article. Internet people love expressing their
                        passionate approval of celebrities' relationship. Such an approval acts like an approval of
                        themselves, telling them you are able to impose control, even a tiny amount of it, in a chaotic
                        world. However, to me such a passion of approval is useless, if you cannot tell whether is true
                        or not. In the case of internet, you know it is not real because managing companies control it.
                        I am fully aware that lot of people enjoy shipping. To me, The reason that I fail to experience
                        such a enjoy is that I never value things that don't contribute my works and my life
                        substantially. If I have to get involved with it, I should be the creator not the enjoyer. That
                        also applies to my opinion towards fan fiction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">For disclaimer, I have no problem with people writing and
                        reading Fan Fiction. If they found it a nice way to entertain themselves, good for them. One
                        thing for sue is that I don't admire them. I want to be the official art creator. I won't create
                        any art that is deemed unofficial. Fan fiction is never official since there are so many
                        versions of them. People write them mostly to entertain themselves and fans for different
                        purposes, some above-table and some under-table like porn. I believe in artist role as a guide.
                        There is a reason why artist tells the story in this way not the others. People should respect
                        the original official version of an art, even though they don't like it. I imagine that there
                        might be fan fictions changing the ending of Roman Polanski's Chinatown because some people
                        cannot stand a mainstream Hollywood-production film can end in such a tragic way. Polanski had
                        just been through serious traumas: his young pregnant wife Sharon Tate was killed by the Manson
                        Family, so Polanski made a choice for the ending of Chinatown to portray the dark, greedy side
                        of humanity: innocent people get killed, the bad guys get away, and the good righteous guys feel
                        helpless. Audience can disagree with the ending but you cannot disrespect it.

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Who is the authority in the field of art? Is there an
                        authority? Should there be an authority? I guess there is no authority in art and there should
                        not be. The problem behind the beef between Nicki Minaj and Peter Rosenberg is that when
                        celebrities have influences, they want to become the authority and the representative of their
                        specialized field of art. Although they are not being real authority, being authority at least
                        in some ways might give people a false feeling of having power. People feel good about having
                        power. In the case of Peter Rosenberg, he believes he has the power to decide what is true Hip
                        Pop and what is not, because of his "legitimate" background. However, how can you tell why Nicki
                        Minaj's songs are not Hip Pop? </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Art is changing and its genre is changing too. Unlike
                        engineers, doctors, archaeologists who work within stipulated traditions and science, artists
                        don't have any boundary. We create according to our visions and what makes artists most proud of
                        is there are people believing in their visions. That is what matters. However, a tendency of
                        complaining still persists. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Art is self-defined though, old influential artists do feel
                        shamed that recently the self-defined art becomes more and more shallow and uninspiring.
                        Influential director Martin Scorsese wrote an article on the New York Times, expressing his
                        concerns because of Netflix and Marvel superhero movies, filmmakers and audience start to treat
                        films as good to cater people's demands. The true soul of films is lost. When everything is so
                        accessible on the internet, the amount of time people would devote to appreciate a piece of art
                        shrinks severely. Artists have to make high-stimulating contents (sex, violence, gun) to attract
                        people's attention. Then people tend to only appreciate art that is high-stimulating. An endless
                        loop it is. Art is not just entertainment. It is also an appreciation and appreciation takes
                        time. Art can only be deep and inspiring, when people spend time on it but most people right now
                        have "no time." </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">I respect how Amanda Palmer uses her action to suggest that
                        celebrities can be directly supported by fans. In fact, I respect and appreciate everyone who is
                        courageous enough to use his/her actions to prove ideas that seem radical and unsound. However,
                        I still feel skeptical. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">I think it is fair for artists to ask their supporters for
                        things such as accommodation and food. Artists possess valuable social or technical capital. For
                        Amanda, the music she created and the music's influence must be very deep and personal to her
                        supports. Such a unique influence can never be bought through money or food or accommodation.
                        However, does maintaining such a closeness with the supports always facilitate the art creation
                        of the artists and the fan activity? I doubt it. People will admire some "god-like" celebrities.
                        Intimate connection between the celebrities and the fan will only injure the image of the
                        celebrities. I guess most of the god-like celebrities might have a superior and masterful social
                        or technical capital people are not able to understand. Fans might perceive the celebrities as
                        non-human. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The other reason I doubt Amanda's idea is that I believe
                        some celebrities need to maintain a mysterious professionalism. Such a mysterious
                        professionalism is essential to their technical capitals. I am not saying that artists such as
                        painters or directors have secrete weapons or secrete methods. Over-exposing their creating
                        process or personal imageries always has me question what make you special? If you are such a
                        mundane human, why can't I create excellent art like you do? </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The dimensions of arousal and dominance does explain what
                        some posts on social media can have more likes and some can not. I think posts of funny memes
                        are high-arousal, because they can evoke happiness. They are also high or medium-dominant; some
                        people might admire how smart the meme creator is. I am not sure whether the two dimensions can
                        explain why sexy bikini photos can attract so many likes. In a way, those posts do consider
                        high-arousal and high-dominant. People who like those posts might admire the bloggers' body
                        shapes and the superficial sexiness. However, I find a lot of people like me who never follow
                        those accounts because to us, those posts are superficial and boring. They are low-arousal and
                        low-dominant.</p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">I guess the dimensions of arousal and dominance are good
                        predicators for the popularity of social media posts in different niches of audience. The way
                        how people see each post to be high or low-arousal is different. I can imagine some posts I find
                        high-arousal might be low-arousal to other people. For example, I love watching posts about
                        people's table set-up. How organize they are? Which monitor and computer they are using? What
                        brand of desk it is? What type of chair they are sitting on. I really like learning about those
                        geeky stuffs and I understand that not everyone love learning about that. If we introduce a
                        third dimension that can categorize the audience into different representative niches. The
                        dimensions of arousal and dominance might be even more effective predicators. </p>

                        high salary. Celebrities are products in a game called "The Hollywood Industrial Complex." The
                        game is a stock market of frame, which in some ways is the same as gambling. You might think you
                        are insightful enough to find evidence a company's stock value will increase soon. If it turns

                        any marketing team. They seem closer to us. They seem more genuine. They seem have the talent or

                        talented. They don't seem to possess the quality and talent that can justify their extremely
                        high salary. Celebrities are products in a game called "The Hollywood Industrial Complex." The
                        game is a stock market of frame, which in some ways is the same as gambling. You might think you
                        are insightful enough to find evidence a company's stock value will increase soon. If it turns
                        out to be true, you are just luck and it is a coincidence. If it turns out to be wrong, don't
                        blame yourself. You never could know in the first place. Celebrities are puppets controlled by
                        their marketing team to generate values from us to keep the business running. Author Jo Piazza
                        might foresee the revolutionary change, a rebirth of entertainment industry in a digital age. At
                        the same time, another kind of internet celebrities is raising. They look like they don't have
                        any marketing team. They seem closer to us. They seem more genuine. They seem have the talent or

                    <h5 class="card-title card--margin-bottom">SCRIPTED GAMES &amp; 9.9% ARISTOCRACY</h5>
                    <h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted card--margin-bottom">10-09-19</h6>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">People might know WWE, car racing, NBA, Football
                        competition are all scripted but they refuse to admit. When Shawn Michael wins the competition,
                        Bret Hart experienced the real confusion any wrestler in the world never experienced until now.
                        Although Shawn doesn't follow the script, but Bret's confusion does reaffirm that such a script
                        exists and people should follow it. It really blows my mind. I personally refuse to watch WWE
                        because I can't stand its brutality. If everything is scripted, wrestlers are not actually
                        fighting but acting. The business nature of hosting games and competitions predicates the fact
                        that everything is scripted. I heard a lot of my friends who watch NBA saying that even though
                        rules say four out of seven wins the final, the association will always make the games to six
                        rounds. It is rarely seen in the history that a team wins consecutively for four rounds. The
                        associate can make more money out of the extra two rounds. Often as an audience you can see
                        which team will win the final at around three or four rounds because referees will clearly
                        demonstrate an unfair protection to the team over the other. How ridiculous it is. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The central problem behind the 9.9 percent Aristocracy is
                        that inequality is irreversible. People get stuck in their class and they will tend to get stuck
                        it forever. Higher class people will use their advantage to become more advantageous. The
                        correlation about education and martial status does resemble to what I learn in another class
                        which studies marriage from a sociological perspective: Children of Divorce. Receiving a good
                        education is really a deciding factor to pretty much everything. Since going to college becomes
                        more and more expensive, the door of education close to poor people. It is true that the
                        American Divorce rate is constantly increasing. The reason is not that the more educated people
                        are, the more independent they will be and the less likely they will get married. It is quite
                        the contrary. It is us who receive good education and decent income in the future. We will more
                        likely to get marry at later ages, have a stable family, raise kids than poor people. The less
                        advantageous still want to marry but less likely to do so because they are unable to. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">I sincerely look down on any fan schools. JRP calling
                        itself the reputable and oldest fan school is one of the most sarcastic things I ever heard. I
                        am not against celebrities in general. I celebrate the achievements made by celebrities who are
                        hard-working, talented, eminent in their areas of specialty, but the business of fan-making
                        looks so superficial and stupid to me. "Tips on training your eyes to sparkle." "9 ways to put
                        charm in your voice." "how to buy a hat." Do you even believe that being charismatic and
                        charming can be as superficial as a few tips? Making a child believe that after going to
                        celebrity school he/she will be famous is really as ridiculous as it sounds. Emma stone is one
                        of my favorites actresses. After she won the Academy Award for best acting because of La La
                        Land, I did feel happy for her, but I read a news article: before Emma taking her very first
                        "formal" acting role in movie "Easy A," she actually dropped out of high school. Trying to
                        convince her parents in her decision, she even made PowerPoint to explain her plan to move to
                        Hollywood and to chase her acting dream. I certainly don't approve her method. Statistically
                        speaking, there might be thousands of teenagers make the same decision like Emma but ends up
                        with nothing. How many of them can get a chance to win an Oscar. Very very few. If fan-making
                        turns into a business, the business does can produce a tiny number of celebrity. However, how
                        about the majority of the kids who receive no formal education but superficial knowledge on how
                        to become famous. How about them? </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">I certainly don't approve the method of fan-making. What I
                        can even not stand is the stupidity of Honey Boo Boo. Watching "the family of six chopping up a
                        roadkill deer for dinner, belly-flopping in the mud" is such a stupid thing that I will not
                        spend any second of my life watching those silly stupid crap. The more and more unequal of the
                        distribution in power mentioned in the article is never an excuse because identifying myself as
                        a filmmaker I believe as content creators we share the social responsibility to reverse the
                        trend and to educate the audience what is good and what is bad. It is true that we cannot
                        educate everyone. There are always people having really bad taste. Some people might argue that
                        watching reality TV like Honey Boo Boo do feel comforting, but what Honey Boo Boo does is feed
                        the audience for meaningless purpose. The true purpose of any media content should be inspiring
                        and thought provoking. </p>

                        really want to be, of course, not because I want to be famous. I believe in my own aesthetics
                        and tastes to tell stories which are unique to my culture and haven't been told. I notice that
                        common celebrities' social media pages tend to feature themselves and what "they" are doing
                        rather than "what" they are doing. Since I want to brand myself as the Wizard (I am the wizard
                        behind the scene, directing the film). I want people to focus on my works: my films, so the only
                        color images among the nine pictures are the screenshots of my films. However, I also want to
                        make people interested in how I direct the films and how the films are made (the magics behind)
                        so each screenshot has its unique behind the scene photos with myself in it, to show the
                        process.</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Poor people are poor not only in terms of their wealth but
                        also their mindset. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">If at one point of their lives, they cannot realize the
                        importance of getting better education, their "poor" mindset will make them even more poor. For
                        rich or middle-class people, their mindset which is mostly the result of better education will
                        definitely make them better and more meaningful lives. The difference between poor and rich
                        mindset can be seen in many aspects. For example, if someone wants to have more money, poor
                        people tend to cut their spending and deposit as much as possible. In their mindset, the best
                        way of having more money is to save it. However, for rich or middle class people, they know how
                        to use money to make money. Of course, there is risk involved but the rate of profit is way
                        higher than poor people can even imagine. In their mindset, they understand how to evaluate the
                        risk of losing but gain a higher chance of profit. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The same logics also applies to buying stuff. They tend to
                        buy luxurious products to show off their "wealth." I believe the article illustrates their inner
                        desire of buying unnecessary expensive products pretty well. What I want to add on is the idea
                        of long term investment and how uneducated poor people can not realize its importance. As we can
                        see from the first example about making money, the reason why poor people tend to deposit is
                        that they can know what they have and what they save right at the moment. What they cannot see
                        and the rich or middle-class people can see is the potential profit coming from a long-term
                        investment. We are willing to sacrifice not having the money right now to receiving a much
                        higher interest rate for the future. If someone wants to buy a vacuum cleaner, poor people will
                        definitely go to buy the one which has probably the highest discount because they believe they
                        are smart and have saved a lot of money. What poor people cannot see is that for the real
                        high-quality well-designed vacuum cleaners, they are always relatively expensive and never have
                        discount. For rich and middle-class people, they might spend 700 dollars buying a Dyson V10
                        vacuum cleaner. What they received is a much better using experience which helps them increase
                        their life quality. The long term benefits of a good vacuum cleaner to their health, using
                        experience, living quality worth way more than 700 dollars.</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The podcast shows a concerns about the long-term
                        development for internet celebrities such as YouTubers. It is impossible for them to create high
                        quality content for free. Most YouTubers did create content for free at the beginning of their
                        career but never in long run. It is totally free to watch YouTube videos, so many people believe
                        what sponsorship? I guess what people should accept at this point is sponsorship is necessary
                        because it can not only give YouTubers sustainable supports but also help them create high
                        quality content for us. There is a website called Patreon where people can support their
                        favorite internet celebrities by donating a certain fee every month. I notice that many
                        YouTubers started to create exclusive content just for their Patreon supporters. I think that
                        logically makes real sense. Having exclusive content not only can differentiate the importance
                        of supporters from other users but also attract more supporters, which in long run will motivate
                        the YouTuber to create even better content.</p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The growth of movies and its celebrities does create more
                        opportunities for women's upward mobility but such a trend is still way less enough to create an
                        sexually equal film industry from a modern point of views. Sternheimer does stress the
                        importance of the early 20th century movie industry in offering women careers and independence
                        they never had before. The onscreen roles and behind screen jobs both greatly promote sexual
                        equality by providing women stable employments. Movies also create positive and inspiring female
                        characters, such as Kathlyn Williams, the "Jungle Actress." However, all those efforts are
                        meaningful but insufficient. Sternheimer mentions that at that time men still controlled the
                        funding and the directing, while they still control them today. Based on my understanding of
                        current movie industry, major areas with relatively balanced gender ratio include production
                        design, producing, screenwriting, make-up, and acting. There are a lot of active award-winning
                        female production designer, producers, screenwriters and etc. However, directors and
                        cinematographers are still majorly male dominated. Only six women are nominated for Best Picture
                        in Oscar's 91 years old history and only one female cinematographer is nominated for Best
                        Cinematography. To create a film industry that embraces diversity, we still have a long way to
                        go.</p>

                        directors. As you can see, I am greatly influenced by three directors: Christopher Nolan, David
                        Fincher and then Quentin Tarantino. Christopher Nolan is the first one that becomes my number
                        one director of all time because of his sci-fi masterpiece Inception. David Fincher is the
                        second one, but his starting point is pretty high, as you can see from the Social Network.
                        However, for Steven Spielberg, I was shocked by the amazing stories and visual effects of his

                        The teen titan really tells a story about how the celebrities and fictional characters influence
                        and shape the celebrities of next generation. Scooter Braun frequently compares the artist he
                        managed to the celebrities and fictional characters he admired. He commends the fact that Justin
                        Bieber can sing, dance, play instruments by saying that "Justin Bieber was born with the
                        Superman powers." To me what Braun does is to glorify something normal (the fact that someone is
                        able to sing, dance, and play instruments is not a big deal) to something amazing. His
                        relationship with many artists and people he helped to become famous can also illustrate that.
                        It is the ability to believe in things and take encouragement from it. Then the questions
                        arises. To me, some fictional characters do serve similar functions as celebrity. Are they
                        counted as celebrity as well?</p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Cavicchi introduces the idea of "audiencing" the reception
                        of performances and works from the perspective of music and listening. In the first two
                        chapters, Cavicchi explores how the practice of audiencing was established in the urban areas
                        and how it is related to other listening practices in church, theater, and oratory. The audience
                        practices deeply embedded in music history. In some ways, it defines what music is and how
                        should we enjoy and perceive it. The book makes me think of the audiencing practice in another
                        art form: film. The common audiencing practice for film is going to movie theater. However,
                        because of the widespread influence from Netflix, there have been many debates about whether
                        internet movies are still considered movies because those movies, mostly funded by Netflix and
                        Amazon, can only be watched online. Without the experience of watching movies in theaters, many
                        people deny internet movies as real movies. One of the three most well-known European film
                        festivals Cannes has closed its door for any internet movie a few years ago. The debates are
                        quite complicated. Influential directors such as Martin Scorsese, the director of "Taxi Driver"
                        and "Goodfellas," used to be against internet movies. Having trouble finding investment for his
                        latest Gangster movie "The Irishman," Scorsese received funding from Netflix. He started to
                        accept the business model of internet movies. Cavicchi shows us how young people integrated
                        music into identity formation. Will our conventional understanding of movies be changed by
                        internet technology? Will people accept that movies which we would never be able to see in the
                        theaters are still movies? Time will tell us the answer.</p>
