                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Unsplash Advanced Search is a a image search engine
                        specifically designed for Unsplash.</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">If you want to search for high-quality photos on the
                        internet, you have powerful search engines like Google, Yahoo. However, their image databases
                        are shitty. There are some high quality images but the majority of them are crappy, low
                        resolution images. Is there free high-quality photos community? Yes there is. Unsplash is one of
                        the most popular high-quality photo communities on the internet. The most awesome part of it is
                        that Unsplash is free. However, on Unsplash website, there is no powerful search engine.
                        Therefore, the purpose of my final project is to incorporate a powerful search engine in a
                        high-quality photo database.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/blog/com-final-api.jpg" class="card--margin-bottom">
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The simple answer is API! I code my Javascrip with JQuery.
                        When user searches image, the search engine will pull the according API data from Unsplash. Once
                        all the data is loaded, I use html and sass to display them on the website. For all the
                        functions, the search engine filters, reorganizes, and redisplay the loaded API data, which is
                        lighter and faster than fetching new data. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">What have I changed? </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">First of all, thanks for the useful feedback from last
                        class. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">1. I design an "delicate" header in the search box so that
                        user will know what the website is for. The reason why I didn't put a header under the logo is
                        that I don't want to break the neat minimalistic layout.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">2. I removed the resolution filter because it is
                        unnecessary. The filter would be useful in Google because Google is filled with low-quality and
                        low-resolution photos. Almost 99% of photos on Unsplash are considered well-crafted and are in
                        relatively high-resolutions, so it wouldn't be useful to keep a resolution filter. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">3. I added a default button for each filter in case user
                        wants to undo filter.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">4. I added a no photos sign if no photo applies to the
                        filter in case user gets confused.
                        wants to undo filter.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">5. I put on my credit and my photo on the website to let
                        people know I made it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">1. Because of limited time, I haven't added the page
                        function. The maximum number of images I could access per page is 30. So adding a page function
                        is necessary to help the users search as many images as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">2. Right now, the filter cannot overlap, which means it
                        limits the possible filter combination users can search. For example, if user wants to search
                        photo with a landscape 3 by 2 aspect ratio and see those photos in order of popularity, being
                        able to combine filter will be handy.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">A tribute to Unsplash's Value & Why I didn't add download
                        button
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The reason why Unsplash is currently the most popular and
                        well-curated photo community online is because it is for free. Under Unsplash's license, anyone
                        can download photos and use them for all purposes including commercial use but saying thanks to
                        the creators is always appreciated. Saying thanks can also help the photographers to gain more
                        exposure. Not having a download button can force the users to go back to Unsplash original site
                        and bring traffic back to the website but also to the creator. I am a photographer on Unsplash.
                        I genuinely appreciate everyone who quotes my photo and brings traffic to my Unsplash account.
                        At the same time, I hope users can also do the same to all the photographers on the site.

                        than the centered 3 columns layout of Unsplash website. Since the purpose of my project:
                        Unsplash advanced search is to let users find the picture they need as fast as possible. So, a
                        wider full-screen 4 columns layout can help them browse content in a faster way.

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Header needed, a little more context</p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Classmates are not familiar with Unsplash's logo. Adding a
                        header below the logo can be helpful in terms of helping them understand the purpose of the
                        search engine. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The purpose of small resolution </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The function to filter the small resolution photos might
                        seem unnecessary. Firstly, since most users tend to search for the photo of the highest quality
                        if possible, to filter out the small resolution is useless. Secondly, photos shared on Unsplash
                        are all "high resolution" in a way. Unlike Google, Unsplash holds a well-curated, high-quality
                        photo database. The bottom line is much higher so users don't need an extra function to filter
                        photos according to their resolutions.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Undo Function </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">There is no undo function so if users want to see the
                        photos in default order, they have to click the search button again, which is not intuitive.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">After looking into a few photo search engine and the API
                        data I can access, I summarize four essential functions users might need and I could realize:
                        resolution, aspect ratio, popularity (most likes), time (most recent). </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The resolution function is pretty easy to realize. By
                        timing the width and height data of the image, I can get the image resolution and compare the
                        resolution to the three if statements (High 40M, Medium 24M, Low 12M), to get the result I need.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/blog/com-final-2-1.jpg" class="card--margin-bottom">
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The aspect ratio function is a little tricky. Since the
                        width and height numbers are not perfectly divisible. For example, a image with 1999px width and
                        2999px height is still counted as 2 by 3 aspect ratio. What I did is to use the math.abs
                        function to get the absolute value of the remainder of width by height. I use an if statement to
                        set a boundary (&#60;0.01,) so the function will only allow images with perfect or approximate 2
                        by 3 aspect ratio to come through. </p>
                    <img src="img/blog/com-final-2-2.jpg" class="card--margin-bottom">
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">PThe popularity function is tricky too. I used the sort()
                        function which has many limitations I have to solve. Firstly, sort() function is supposed to
                        sort one dimensional array but the API data I received from Unsplash is a complex
                        multi-dimensional array. So I define a new one dimensional array called "popularity" to store
                        only the numbers of likes and let the sort function to sort the popularity array. Secondly,
                        sort() function is supposed to sort strings array but I only need to sort numbers. So I use an
                        extra sortNumber function() to limit the capability of the sort function. </p>


                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">I am still working on the time function. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Unsplash's search engine is too simplified, lacking the
                        basic functions which can help the users filter the photos they need. As you can see, if I
                        search for "car," I can only filter photos in the given key words: sports car, Lamborghini, Bmw,
                        etc. The website cannot show the photos of certain aspect ratio users are looking for. It cannot
                        show the photos in terms of popularity. It cannot show photos with the highest resolution
                        possible. Those are functions I believe users need and improves the overall user experience.

                        function which allowed user to choose what the eyes should follow. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> When making this new function, I found a hack to
                        understand the new data library you use. That is to output relevant variable on the screen. When
                        I first try to understand the PostNet code, I “decompose” the program structure by understanding
                        what variables are defined and where they are used. My first useful tip is the naming of the
                        variables can tell what it is for, such as “post” and “keypoint.score.” Then “i” variable and
                        “j” variable caught my attention. I don’t know what they are for; they might relate to the
                        numbering. So I use the text() function, to output the variables with the keypoint. I
                        immediately know what they are for. “I” represents the numbers of people and “J” represents the
                        body position of each person. </p>

                    <code class="card--margin-bottom">text("i="+i+" j="+j, keypoint.position.x,
                        keypoint.position.y)</code>



                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">To add the position tracking function means to track which
                        “j” variables. I add a few buttons with according functions that changes the trackPoint
                        variable. The function is realized.

                    <h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted card--margin-bottom">11-17-19</h6>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> Why computation is important to me? I have been wandering
                        between the fields of filmmaking and computation media for about two years. I regard these two
                        fields as my parallel interests and specialty because I have equal passions for both of them.
                        However, for a long time, I fail to find the connection between these two. I can obviously feel
                        that my two interests do benefit from each other but I don't know how. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Computation and filmmaking are fundamentally unrelated.
                        Believe me it is true. The fundamental working philology are different. We code to solve
                        problem. I think what IMA stands out from conventional computer science major is that we learn
                        how to solve problems in a beautiful way. We make film to tell a story which represents a vision
                        or an argument. Some people might disagree with me, by saying that computation and filmmaking
                        are storytelling. That is cliché and bullshit in a sense. As long as we live and breath,
                        anything we do is all story-telling. It is meaningless to tell such a widely known truth, like
                        telling everyone the importance of critical thinking. The reason I fail to find the connection
                        between these two is that even though some people argue that computation is also storytelling,
                        the way how we tell stories are very distinct. To appreciate the beauty of computation and
                        filmmaking, you need to realize their distinctiveness. I admit computation facilitates film
                        industry in technical aspect especially in visual effect. Computation widely expand our
                        imagination in movies. Without it, there will be no Star Wars. Without Star Wars, the modern
                        cinema we know today will no longer exist.</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> However my argument in the beginning doesn't defy the fact
                        that computation facilitates filmmaking, what I am saying is that computation and filmmaking are
                        fundamentally unrelated. As a director, writer, or director of cinematography, editor, the most
                        "antique" titles in filmmaking, one immersive themselves in creating film. You enter into a
                        totally territory. When you build a character and the story, you are constantly thinking about
                        its inner or outer conflict, the complexity of humanity. When you draw storyboard, you are
                        looking in the aesthetics, the framing, the composition. All of them are unrelated in any way to
                        computation.</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> Then, why computation is important to me? I spend almost
                        my entire extracurricular time and energy in moving making either working on my films or helping
                        others, so why I didn't transfer to a Film and Television? To me, studying computation rather
                        than film helps me stand out from most of other filmmakers because the beauty and intricacy of
                        computation enhance my ability to make film efficiently and meticulously. Efficiency and
                        meticulousness are valuable qualities. Filmmaking is time-consuming. I won't say a director's
                        vision and directing style are the most important part of filmmaking. Those things are more than
                        important because they are required. An excellent and sustainable director must learn how to
                        make film in a organized and timely manner. The ability to come up with awesome film idea is not
                        rare, what is rare is that you not only have good idea and can turn that idea into a complete
                        well-polished film. Studying computation is a training for me. I am trained to pay attention to
                        every detail, because any minor error in any phase is not allowed. The intricate structure of
                        object-orient programing is also a good training of my logical reasoning, which helps me ability
                        to create complex characters' structures and storyline. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">I utilize the Unsplash Photo database API for the
                        assignment. Because Unsplash is one of the best high quality photo-sharing community on the
                        internet and it is for free, people download photos from it frequently. However, Unsplash
                        doesn't feature a well-designed filters, so I design a Unsplash search engine which features the
                        most basic filter function (landscape or portrait ratio). </p>

                    <img src="img/blog/com-hw-7-1.jpg" class="card--margin-bottom">

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> Realizing the function is simple and straightforward.
                        First, I use JQuery to get the API data from Unsplash and show it on the web. JQuery I believe
                        is the most efficient JavaScript language since it is object-oriented from the ground. I use the
                        selector to target the button and then I use JSON to get the API data from Unsplash. To add the
                        photos to my website, I use the append() function to access the DOM. </p>


                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Since the accessed API data is stored through var
                        currentList, I can reuse it for the filter function.
                    </p>
                    <code class="card--margin-bottom">var APIKey =
                        "c3ba5fa8e844fc1b4ef1ca56625e6e625aa111c6f8d5a0a68ff985fe5f001866";<br>
                        var currentList;</code>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">I access the image height and width variables; then I use
                        an if statement to compare them.

                    <code class="card--margin-bottom">var imageWidth = val.width;<br>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> Artificial Intelligence is unstoppable. Does it mean that
                        our future will be like the movie "Matrix" where A.I. destroys our lives and turn us into their
                        batteries? Not necessarily. Will Artificial Intelligence bring well-being to human races or
                        troubles. It is hard to give an answer. However, there is one thing for sure. Artificial
                        Intelligence is unstoppable and this overall tendency is detrimental to creative and meaningful
                        arts. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Internet connects each others, as a result it creates an
                        explosion of data and information. Artificial Intelligence and algorithm are important and
                        necessary because they bring machine-generated "order" to the chaos. The central idea behind the
                        "order" is efficiency. How can we navigate ourselves and find things we need in the explosion of
                        information which might cost us 1 million years to go through? We can't at least without
                        Artificial Intelligence and algorithm. So, are Artificial Intelligence and algorithm evil like
                        the Uber drivers complain in the article? It might be to some people, but there is no better
                        way?</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> Why I believe artificial intelligence and algorithm are
                        detrimental to creative and meaningful arts? because such an efficiency is shallow and
                        uninspiring. One of the most influential directors of all time but also Tisch Alumni Martin
                        Scorsese writes an article in the New York Times recently. He believes right now it is really
                        such a depressing time for cinema and it will be even more depressing in the future. Disney and
                        Netflix which take uncountable monetary advantage from internet and A.I. algorithm are behind
                        such a tendency. When internet makes everything accessible, the number of TV shows and movies
                        skyrockets. The average time users spent with each movie largely decreases. In order to attract
                        more attention, Disney and Netflix have to "feed" people with movies that are attractive from
                        the outside (beauty, sex, violence, superhero) but shallow in the inside. That is never why
                        cinema is invented. "Cinema was about revelation - aesthetic, emotional and spiritual
                        revelation. It was about characters - the complexity of people..." For superhero movies, there
                        is no revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made
                        to satisfy a specific set of demands. It takes time to make good and thought-provoking films.
                        The essence of the film is never to satisfy a specific demand. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> Algorithm should never curate our content or at least some
                        part of it. As an artist, we should be our curators. We should dare to challenge what algorithm
                        and most people call mainstream. We should challenge them and tell our stories through our
                        unique visions. Surprise them and tell them that "that is a good story not Marvel." </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The way I achieve the endless bouncing is through a
                        non-degrading "speed" variable. A constantly increasing "speed" variable is adding to the y
                        location of the balls, since as ball approaches the ground, the acceleration will increase
                        because of the gravity.

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">However, when ball hits the ground and starts the next
                        round of bouncing. The directionality of the acceleration should be reversed and the maximum
                        acceleration it can achieve should be smaller. In the code, I reversed the direction without
                        degrading the value.

                    <h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted card--margin-bottom">11-03-19</h6>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> I have "obsessive compulsive disorder" especially in
                        organizing and backing up my data. I have developed a high-efficient backup system but I still
                        raise many concerns about the future of my data. Here is why. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Currently, I have used both cloud backup, mostly OneDrive,
                        iCloud, Google Drive but also local DAS backup (3*2TB HDD Hard drive, 4*4TB HDD hard drive,
                        1*10TB HDD thunderbolt drive, 1*4TB high speed SSD raid, 2*1TB SSD hard drive). The way how I
                        incorporate all those 11 drives into my daily working system is that I categorize them into
                        three groups.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Working group: 1*4TB high speed SSD raid, 2*1TB SSD hard
                        drive <br>Transfer group: 1*10TB HDD thunderbolt drive <br>Transfer group: 1*10TB HDD
                        thunderbolt drive <br>Cloud-based backup: OneDrive, iCloud, Google Drive
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/blog/com-hw-6.jpg" class="card--margin-bottom">
                    <p>Left top: 4TB HDD Backup Drive. Left down: 10TB HDD Transfer Drive. Right: 1TB SSD Working Drive
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Working disks are usually high speed SSD drives which can
                        greatly speed up my workflow in terms of loading and rendering files. Transfer disks are the
                        "transfer station." All my working files will be backed up to transfer station. It also stores
                        finished project files which I might use for portfolio purposes in foreseeable future. The
                        backup disks store project files I finished years ago. For cloud-based backup, I only will
                        upload the finished products. For example, if the project is a film, I will only backup the
                        finished editing. Here are a few problems which worries me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Drives have life span and I haven't come up with a way to
                        efficiently migrate my data to new drives. More importantly, I don't know when the hard drive
                        will die. Unlike tape drive which can last longer than a decade, hard disk drive (HDD) can only
                        last 5-6 years. A few of my backup disks are close to 5 years life span. The data is stored
                        across different partitions in the hard disk. Some of the partitions inside the backup drive
                        fail. The useable capacity shrinks significantly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">Not having a stable high-speed internet limits the
                        possibility of cloud-based backup. If you backup your data to cloud. Since cloud-based service
                        doesn't store your data in one specific disk inside a server, like how I backup myself. The data
                        is actually allocated across multiple disks and multiple servers. It seems safer and more
                        malleable. Companies such as Microsoft can redistribute the data from old malfunctioning disks
                        and retire them. However, how can I know my data is safe and the company didn't access my files?
                        How can I access those files if I don't have internet? Besides, it happens many times that
                        because my latest working files are too large to back up in time, when I am away from home and
                        work on my laptop, I just realize the files I am working on are not the latest.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">In foreseeable future, I think SSD might be the solution.
                        SSD is stable and durable because it stores data on flash memory chips. Unlike tape drive or
                        HDD, it won't lose magnetics. However, SSD is still too expensive in terms of capacity and there
                        is a physical limitation on how much flash memory chips can be squeezed on the motherboard. I
                        guess we won't achieve the ultimate solutions that can solve all the problems at one time. What
                        we can do is to solve problems time by time.

                        which will freeze the animation. The value can also not be 1, which will accelerate the
                        animation to a point that is hard to see it. From 0.2 to 0.7 seems to be an appropriate range

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> I planned to apply what we learnt on class to add more
                        flavors to my previous waving cube design. The photocell can tell the brightness of the
                        surrounding environment so I imagine that I could use it to control the brightness of the
                        background color. I also planned to use the potentiometer to control the maximum size of the
                        changing cube since potentiometer is the only controller we have, which can accurately adjust
                        the value. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> The first step was to incorporate the waving cube code to
                        the code Dan gave us on class. I copied and pasted the core of my waving cube code: the
                        createCube() function. </p>
                    <code class="card--margin-bottom">function createCube(numCols, numRows, maxCircleSize, strokeSize,
                        bgColor, strokeColor)</code>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">The next step was to modify the output from the Arduino. I
                        initialized two values and divided them with the commas.
                    </p>
                    <code class="card--margin-bottom">int value1 = analogRead(A0);<br>
                        int value2 = analogRead(A1);<br>
                        Serial.print(value1);<br>
                        Serial.print(",");<br>
                        Serial.println(value2);</code>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> The third step was to modify the Dan's gotData() function.
                        I printed the two values out, to check whether everything works fine. After remapping the
                        values, I inputted the new values into my createCube() function. Since the createCube() function
                        was wrapped in the gotData() function, while the gotData() function was wrapped in the setup()
                        function, which the program would run in default. There was no need to have an extra draw()
                        function.
                    </p>
                    <code class="card--margin-bottom">println("value 1:"+sensors[0]);<br>
                        println("value 2:"+sensors[1]);
                        <br><br>
                        var color = map(sensors[0],0,255,0,255);<br>
                        var size = map(sensors[1],10,1023,20,300);<br>
                        createCanvas(canWidth, canWidth);<br>
                        createCube(numRows, numRows, size, strokeSize, color, strokeColor);</code>

                        there are people standing in front of the paintings, the character will not move at all. If
                        there is no one standing in front of the painting (at least no one stands right in front of the
                        painting), the character will move, such as yawning, looking around or walking out of the frame.

                        moving all the major algorithm into this function. The function I created is called createCube
                        and it includes all the variables user are going to change. </p>

                        that control each variables.
                    </p>
                    <code class="card--margin-bottom">text0 = createElement('h3', 'canvas size');<br> slider0 =

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> Slider will have a default value, so when declaring the
                        variables at the beginning of the code, I don't need to assign a value to it.
                    </p>
                    <code class="card--margin-bottom">slider = createSlider(minimum value, maximum value, default value,

                        function to store the value of the slider. I then input all the variables in the function. </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">A few problems I hope to improve. Having a front-end web
                        development background, I found DOM is very inefficient in writing HTML. I usually use class to
                        define all the CSS and then add the class to the div to apply the styling but in DOM I cannot
                        create class. I want to use the flexbox feature of CSS so that every time user changes the size
                        of the canvas, the position of all the sliders can change accordingly. </p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> We are connected by the little devices we carry everyday:
                        cell phones and the network cell phones connect to: internet. Today, cell phones are so capable
                        and we are using them so naturally that we don't even realize we are using them: making phone
                        calls, texting friends on social medias, searching the internet, taking photos, finding places
                        on Google Map, paying, etc. We enjoy a level of convenience we never have before throughout
                        human history, while at the same time we are actively uploading and exposing our data to the
                        internet at a rate we also never have before throughout our history. In China, mobile payment
                        such as WeChat pay and Alipay become so widespread that people tend not to bring any cash. We
                        can pay the exact amount of money, no need for change. Every time we make a transaction via
                        mobile payment, lots of our information are exposed: our location where the transaction happen,
                        the time we make the transaction, the amount of money we spent, and our transaction record which
                        will be saved to the server of Central Bank of China. So what? The question are we willing to
                        sacrifice our information security with everyday convenience might not be central to our
                        problem. In countries such as China, how the country runs is so different from western countries
                        that people don't even have the choice to reject it. In some area, such as banking, the central
                        government technically owns the majority of companies. The transaction you made anywhere or
                        anytime even prior to mobile payment will be recorded by the Central Bank of China, unless you
                        are living in a 100% cash-based way of living, which is unrealistic. We know it and we "embrace"
                        it because we might not have a second choice. If that is the case, I guess the sarcastic lesson
                        we Chinese always ask ourselves is that did I do something wrong. Only if we did something
                        wrong, our data will become "valuable" for the government to track down. If not, I guess most
                        Chinese will say "just relax." The logics might seem very absurd but I guess is true?</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> The development of computer graphics makes human society
                        more and more visual-driven than any other time throughout the history. Some people say it is a
                        good thing since photos and images are very efficient in communicating ideas. We see things
                        faster than read things. Some people say too much relying on photos and images is dangerous,
                        because they can be deceiving and biased. Should we worry about that the images we see are
                        subjective and deceiving?</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">"We create meaning about the world around us through the
                        use of language and images." In another word, we understand the world through representing it.
                        It has been long debated about whether the system of representation truly reflect the world as
                        it is. The purpose of the debate sounds reasonable but how do people define "truly?" How do
                        people define "objective?"</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">People have to accept that we never can truly or
                        objectively represent the world as it is. if people are involved in the process, things never
                        can be represented objectively because we as humans have limited knowledge. Consequently, our
                        judgement and representation are always biased and reflected on the knowledge we acquire of. The
                        invention of modern computer graphics even complicates it because we have so many ways of
                        representing the world. Instead of worrying about it, I suggest we should embrace and see the
                        beauty behind our "biased" representation: the uniqueness of each way of representing the world.
                        For example, motion pictures are so efficient in telling interesting non-linear stories through
                        light, camera, action and so on: the beauty of cinema. Poetry is so unique in its concise and
                        thought-provoking sentences: the beauty of language. Computer games are so interactive that
                        users can be part of the story: the beauty of interactive media. <b>New ways are emerging and
                            old ways never die.</b></p>

                        color blind but instead of seeing color he is able to hear color through the antenna device he
                        implants in his body. What my light sensitive speak does is help people to "hear" light. I use a
                        photoresistor as the analog input, which can convert the surrounding light information to analog
                        signal which is then converted to sound information through the speaker.</p>

                    <code class="card--margin-bottom code--center">map (value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh)</code>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom"> One of the challenges is how to use the map function to
                        create fully functionable light sensitive speaker. Map function can remap a number to a defined
                        range. In the first test, at certain analog inputs, the speaker is mute. If the speaker is mute,
                        not giving out any feedback, the user will be blind. So, I re-adjust the lowest and highest
                        value of the map function to make sure the speaker always make sound which will give instant
                        feedback to the users when the light changes.</p>

                        contradictory but it is true. The opening paragraph of Marshall Mccluhan's "The Medium is the
                        Message" summarizes a fundamental idea pretty well: the medium serves as an extension of
                        ourselves. The purpose of the medium, or some might say the underlying message of any medium,
                        always stays the same: they are tools serving us. The basic function of the advanced IBM's
                        server-level computer is the same as the rock human used to make fire millions of years ago.</p>

                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">If everything is constantly changing, change will lose its
                        meaning. Change won't make a difference since everything is changing. Change is only valid when
                        something stays the same and that change can make a difference on it. In another world, we
                        evolve because the way how we solve problem changes to a higher and higher, more and more
                        efficient level but throughout the history the fundamental problem we are solving (the extension
                        of ourselves) never changes. How is Computational media different from previous media?
                        Efficiency changes. Computational media is a product of the highest efficiency we can create
                        today but the idea of efficiency has no maximum. The efficiency of problem-solving would be a
                        eternal challenge for the entire human race.</p>

                        different way to present the three possible outputs. Then I decided to make the light blink and
                        use the time difference between each blink to indicate the output.</p>

                        To find out what can or can't be used as variable, or stored or be remembered, one has to
                        understand the purpose of technology, the idea of "assistive technology." The article All
                        Technology is Assistive makes me think of an invention initially designed for the disable but
                        everyone is using it every day. Think about what we are doing the most on our cell phones except
                        listening to music and watching videos. It is not hard to find out the answer: we are texting
                        all the time, on our social media applications, messages, email, etc. I guess twenty years ago
                        the most typical way normal people communicate with each other is either talk in real life or
                        through a phone call. However, I believe at this point if people are separated, people tend to
                        text rather than talk to each others. Why?
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">
                        It is shocking that our most common way of communicating with each other in the era of mass
                        media is initially designed for deaf and mute people because they cannot speak or hear. For
                        either talking or texting, their functions stay the same to help people communicate. so the
                        question I asked in the very beginning about the boundary of mass media communication can be
                        traced back to the question about boundary in the era before mass media communication when
                        people tend to talk on the phone and write things on their notebook. At that time, do we have
                        rules about what can be stored and remembered. I guess we do and we always do. Technology always
                        serve the same fundamental functions: the extension of sense. What is changing is the way how we
                        set up the boundaries as technology changes.

                        the liquid is conductive, the light will be on. The more conductive the liquid is, the higher
                        the intensity of the light will be. In the video, I poured some tap water. It is interesting
                        that tap water is not conductive as we think, since the light is off. After I add some salt, the
                        water immediately started to become conductive and the light is on. As I stir the water, the
                        water becomes more conductive which can be told by the increasing intensity of the light.</p>

                        Human is well-known for creating powerful tools throughout the history: camera, telephone,
                        vehicle, airplane, and of course the foundation of all modern electronic devices——computers. The
                        reason why I believe everyone should care about computer or computation is that you are using
                        them every single day consciously or unconsciously. Some people might argue that they never use
                        computer because they do not own one.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">
                        Then the question arises. What are computers? How do you define computers? To many people,
                        computers might only refer to the large, black, box-size desktops or small light-weight laptops
                        but is it true? I have the experience building my own desktop workstation from buying all "the
                        elements:" CPU, GPU, RAM, cooling system, power system, hard drives to connecting everything up
                        like building LEGO, then setting up the system and tweaking the performance by overclocking. So,
                        I probably have a more "tangible" understanding of the computer. To me, anything that has a
                        central processing unit (CPU), which means it is able to process and execute commands, is
                        considered as a computer. Given that definition, cell-phone, digital camera, microwave, washing
                        machine are all computers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text card--margin-bottom">
                        However, the definition might go out of date very soon because the invention of the cloud. Cloud
                        computation means all the processing and computation moves from the local to the server. The
                        advantage is that the performance of cloud computer can have no limit. Performance is not just
                        about how powerful the CPU or GPU is. Performance is a complicated factor that considers not
                        only the hardware but also the cooling. Laptop's performance is always not as good as desktop's
                        because it is too thin to cool the motherboard well. In contrast, servers are optimized for
                        cooling because it is designed to process huge amount of workflow 24 hours 7 days at all time.
                        The disadvantage is that user need internet connection, since you need internet to send commands
                        to the serve and the server would send the computing result to you. Previously I thought
                        computer needs CPU to process, which is the reason why I define everything that has a CPU is a
                        computer. In the near future, the internet becomes more and more essential in the process of
                        computing. Doesn't it mean that the future definition of computer should also include internet?
                        I guess we will see.
